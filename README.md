# Tetris

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tetris in Python using the Pygame library.

## Game Summary

In this version of Tetris, players can:
- Move pieces left and right using arrow keys
- Rotate pieces using the up arrow key
- Accelerate piece descent using the down arrow key

The game ends when the stack of Tetrominos reaches the top of the play field.

## How to Play

Use the arrow keys to move and rotate the Tetrominoes. The game will end when a new Tetromino cannot be placed at the starting position.
